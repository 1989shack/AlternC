The po files here are automatically generated by repos-to-tx.sh

Don't edit them in any way !

If you need to add automatically translated string, use po-debconf for debian templates, or _("") and __("") in php code for the desktop

If you have manual text that can't use _("") or __("") add it to bureau/locales/manual.pot instead, and relaunch repos-to-tx.sh
